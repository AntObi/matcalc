"""
Define commonly used text fixtures. These are meant to be reused in unittests.
- Fixtures that are formulae (e.g., LiFePO4) returns the appropriate pymatgen Structure or Molecule based on the most
  commonly known structure.
- Fixtures that are prefixed with `graph_` returns a (structure, graph, state) tuple.

Given that the fixtures are unlikely to be modified by the underlying code, the fixtures are set with a scope of
"session". In the event that future tests are written that modifies the fixtures, these can be set to the default scope
of "function".
